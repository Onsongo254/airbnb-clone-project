### 🧪 QA Engineer (Optional Role)
Ensures the quality of the application through test planning, execution, and reporting. This role covers writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, using tools to automate regression testing, and working closely with developers to identify bugs early in the lifecycle.

## 🗄️ Database Design

The project uses a relational database (MySQL) to model real-world relationships between users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments. Below are the key entities and their core fields:

### 🧑 Users
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `name`: Full name of the user  
- `email`: Unique email address  
- `password`: Hashed password  
- `role`: Host or Guest  

**Relations**:  
- A user can list multiple properties (as a host)  
- A user can make multiple bookings (as a guest)  
- A user can leave multiple reviews  

### 🏠 Properties
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `title`: Property title  
- `description`: Detailed info  
- `location`: City, state, country  
- `host_id`: References `Users.id`  

**Relations**:  
- A property belongs to one user (host)  
- A property can have many bookings and reviews  

### 📅 Bookings
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `user_id`: References `Users.id`  
- `property_id`: References `Properties.id`  
- `check_in`: Start date  
- `check_out`: End date  

**Relations**:  
- A booking belongs to one user and one property  
- Each booking can have a corresponding payment  

### ⭐ Reviews
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `user_id`: References `Users.id`  
- `property_id`: References `Properties.id`  
- `rating`: Numeric score  
- `comment`: User feedback  

**Relations**:  
- A review is made by a user for a specific property  

### 💳 Payments
- `id`: Unique identifier  
- `booking_id`: References `Bookings.id`  
- `amount`: Total payment  
- `status`: Paid, Pending, Failed  
- `payment_date`: Timestamp  

**Relations**:  
- A payment is tied to one booking  

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project is composed of several core features that simulate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. Each feature is designed to provide a seamless and secure user experience while reflecting modern software design patterns.

### 👤 User Management
Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. This feature supports role-based access (hosts and guests), enabling personalized dashboards and access control.

### 🏘️ Property Management
Hosts can create, edit, and delete property listings, including uploading images, setting availability, and adding descriptions. This feature allows hosts to showcase their spaces and make them available for booking.

### 📅 Booking System
Guests can browse properties and create bookings based on availability. The system checks for date conflicts, calculates prices, and ensures secure booking transactions.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Integrates a secure payment system where guests can pay for bookings and hosts can track earnings. Payment statuses (e.g., Paid, Pending) are managed and linked to bookings.

### ⭐ Review System
Guests can leave ratings and reviews after a stay, which helps build trust and reputation for hosts and properties. Reviews include a score and optional comment visible on the property listing.

### 🔒 API Security & Authentication
JWT-based authentication ensures that only authorized users can access or modify data. This feature protects user data, enforces permissions, and guards against common security threats.

### ⚙️ CI/CD Integration
Automated pipelines (via GitHub Actions) handle code testing, building, and deployment. This ensures faster development cycles and reduces manual errors during deployment.

### 📄 Documentation & Planning
Includes well-maintained README files, API documentation, and database design plans. Clear documentation supports team collaboration and eases onboarding for new developers.

## 🔐 API Security

Securing backend APIs is critical to protecting user data, financial transactions, and maintaining the integrity of the platform. The Airbnb Clone project incorporates the following key security measures:

### ✅ Authentication
We use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** to authenticate users. Each user must log in to receive a token, which is required for accessing protected endpoints. This ensures that only verified users can interact with personal data and sensitive features.

### 🔓 Authorization
Role-based access control is enforced to distinguish between guests and hosts. For example, only hosts can manage property listings, and only guests can book properties. This prevents unauthorized actions and preserves data ownership boundaries.

### 🚫 Rate Limiting
API rate limiting is applied to restrict the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame. This protects the system from abuse, brute-force attacks, and ensures fair usage across users.

### 🔒 Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords are hashed using secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt). All communication between clients and the server is encrypted via HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 🛡️ Input Validation & Error Handling
Strict input validation is implemented to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common attack vectors. Errors are handled gracefully without exposing internal logic or stack traces to users.

### Why Security Matters

- **Protecting User Data**: Personally identifiable information (PII) like names, emails, and passwords must be safeguarded to maintain user trust and comply with data protection regulations.
- **Securing Payments**: Payment transactions involve sensitive financial data that must be protected to prevent fraud and unauthorized access.
- **Maintaining Platform Integrity**: Proper authentication and authorization prevent malicious users from altering, deleting, or accessing resources they shouldn't.
- **Ensuring Availability**: Rate limiting and secure coding practices help defend against DDoS attacks and application crashes, keeping the platform reliable and responsive.
