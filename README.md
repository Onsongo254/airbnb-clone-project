# 🏠 Airbnb Clone Project

## Overview
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a real-world, full-stack development initiative that simulates the architecture and functionality of the popular Airbnb booking platform. This project emphasizes backend development, database architecture, API design, and application security, all within a collaborative team environment. It's designed to help learners build scalable systems using modern software development practices.

## Project Goals
- Recreate the core functionalities of a booking platform like Airbnb.
- Develop a scalable backend system with secure and well-documented APIs.
- Design a relational database to manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and more.
- Practice team-based development using GitHub workflows and collaborative planning.
- Integrate Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for seamless delivery.
- Apply advanced security practices to protect user data and system integrity.

## Tech Stack

### 👨‍💻 Backend
- **Django**: Primary backend web framework for building APIs and server-side logic.
- **GraphQL**: For flexible and efficient API queries and mutations.

### 🗄️ Database
- **MySQL**: Relational database system for structured data storage and relationships.

### 🔒 Security
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure user authentication.
- **Django Middleware & Permissions**: For API access control and data protection.

### ⚙️ DevOps
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

### 📦 Version Control
- **Git & GitHub**: Source code management and team collaboration.
